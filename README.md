# Universal Paradox games checksum patcher

This is a lightweight patch, that forces game ignore checksum when starting and loading ironman game.

In other words, yes, it gives you the ability to get achievements with mods enabled. And not giving you ability to use game console or connect to servers with other checksum.

# Installation

1. Download latest binary of patcher from releases (or build it in case you know what you doing)
2. Unzip it in game directory (rightclick on game on steam > Manage > Browse local files)
3. Run paradox-checksum-patcher.exe or paradox-checksum-patcher

Conrats, you done! In case you see unsupported version error most likely Paradox broke something and all you can do is wait until i update patch.
