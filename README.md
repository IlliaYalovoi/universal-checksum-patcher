This is a lightweight patch, that forces game ignore checksum wherever it is used. 

In other words, yes, it gives you the ability to get achievements with mods enabled.

# Installation

1. Download latest binary of patcher from releases (or build it in case you know what you doing)
2. Unzip it in eu4 directory (rightclick on eu4 on steam > Manage > Browse local files)
